# Privacy Policy

This privacy notice tells you what to expect when the DDB collects personal information. We may change this notice by updating this page and you should check from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes.

## Introduction

The DDB is committed to process any personal information it holds only in ways that are fair, transparent and meet its legal obligations.

## DDB Users

We collect contact details in order to ensure the service that we supply.
That includes, but is not limited to, the administration of joining the app, verification of identity, the supply of critical information to the Police and Cave Rescue Organisations.

### Personal Data: Name, Address, contact telephone number, Car Registration Number etc

The data that we collect is used only for administrative purposes.  It will only be used to verify identity and in the event that the Police and Cave Rescue Organisation are contacted in connection with the operation of the Application.

### Statistics

We gather statistics with respect to the numbers of cavers visiting caves but do not store personal data in relation to that function.

### Data Retention
Once a user cancels their account, we will retain sufficient information to identify the previous user. This allows the previous username to be used again if the user re-joins.

## How long do we retain your data?
For members that register on our Application, we store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Administrators can also see and edit that information.

## What rights do you have over your data?
The DDB tries to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people access to their personal information. Individuals can find out if we hold any personal information by asking us. This is formally known as a ‘subject access request’ under the Data Protection Act 1998. If we do hold information about you, we will:

* give you a description of it
* tell you why we are holding it
* tell you who it could be disclosed to
* let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form

To make a request for any personal information we may hold you need to put the request in writing to the address provided below.
If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example by providing you with the specific information you need over the telephone.

If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes or delete your data. You can find out more about the rights you have at [https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/).
We may make a charge of up to £10 for a request.
