## Welcome to Digital Destination Board!

### About

The Digital Destination Board (DDB) is a mobile app that allows cavers to enter details of their trips, so that they can be monitored for the purpose of rescue callouts. When your trip goes overdue, a team of selected SWCC members will be notified automatically so that they can take appropriate action.
